**Repository of scripts from R user dicussion group (PE&RC graduate school)**

This repository belong to the R user discussion group of [PE&RC](https://www.pe-rc.nl/) graduate school of [Wageningen University](http://www.wur.nl/). It gives access to [R scripts](https://github.com/wageningen/RUsers/tree/master/Meeting_RScripts) presented during its meetings and [links](https://github.com/wageningen/RUsers/wiki) to R learning resources.

The Wageningen R user group is meant for all R users connected to graduate school PE&RC, and/or Wageningen University and Research,  and anybody else interested in working with R. Itâ€™s focus is the language R itself, rather than statistics in general. Most of our members are PhD candidates, but also Bachelor and Master students, and everybody else is welcome. Any questions, suggestions, or do you want te be informed about our monthly meetings? Contact us by r-users@wur.nl.

The maintainers of the repository are [Benjamin Brede](link) and [Luc Steinbuch](https://github.com/LucSteinbuch), but it is willing that any member of this group suggests and/or edits the content of this page.

We ran a survey about the most interesting topics in our group. [Here](https://github.com/wageningen/RUsers/blob/master/Presentations/survey_RuserGroup.pdf.pdf) you can see the results.
